## Challenge 2 - Telco Customer Churn Prediction ‚òéÔ∏è
<b> Problem Statement </b> <br>
The development of the telecommunications industry has tightened competition between providers. In addition, customers have the right to choose a provider that suits their needs and can switch (churn) from their previous provider. This can lead to reduced revenue for telecommunications companies, so it is important to address it.

<b> Objective </b> <br>
Build a classification model that can recognize customers who have the potential to churn from telecommunications services. Thus, companies can take action to retain customers.
